# Media3_compose_app
This is a simple android application that plays audio files in user devices using media 3
Modern UI toolkit is used to create the varoius elements that allow a user to interact with the application
The app uses Media 3 MediaSessionService for background playback. I did my best to follow correct coding practices while buidling this app
